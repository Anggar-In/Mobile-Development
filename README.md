# Anggar.In Mobile Development Project Explanation
This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2.

**Project Background:**

Financial stability is crucial for personal and societal well-being, yet many Indonesians face challenges in achieving it. Data from BPS and a 2023 DBS survey indicate a large portion of household income is spent on non-essential items without proper planning. This issue is compounded by low financial literacy, leading to unnecessary spending and limiting the ability to save. If left unaddressed, these problems may prolong financial instability and negatively affect the quality of life in Indonesia.

To tackle this issue, our team developed Anggar.In, a comprehensive financial management solution. The app helps users track income and expenses through manual input, receipt scanning, and voice commands, offering a clear view of spending patterns. Its personalized budgeting feature aids in managing spending limits, while savings goal planning supports consistent savings. Anggar.In also provides financial analysis tools, presenting spending trends and insights to help users become more aware of their finances. The investment recommendation system can also guide users towards financial freedom.

Leveraging machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile technology, Anggar.In aims to boost financial awareness, foster sustainable habits, and support informed decision-making, helping Indonesians navigate economic challenges and build long-term financial resilience.


**Mobile Development:** 

from the beginning our team created a project theme about a transaction recording application, then we as mobile developers, first created a UI/UX design using figma from the application, then discussed with the team whether they agreed with the design. Then after the UI design was completed, we created a prototype as the application flow runs on the device later. Then after that we implemented the UI into the application using Android Studio using XML. Then after the machine learning team finished creating the model, then the cloud computing team created the API to be given to the mobile development team. We immediately integrated the API using the retrofit library from Android, which means that this application is used online using the internet.
