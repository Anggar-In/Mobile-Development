# Anggar.In Mobile Development Project Explanation
This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2.

**Project Background:**

Financial stability is crucial for personal and societal well-being, yet many Indonesians face challenges in achieving it. Data from BPS and a 2023 DBS survey indicate a large portion of household income is spent on non-essential items without proper planning. This issue is compounded by low financial literacy, leading to unnecessary spending and limiting the ability to save. If left unaddressed, these problems may prolong financial instability and negatively affect the quality of life in Indonesia.

To tackle this issue, our team developed Anggar.In, a comprehensive financial management solution. The app helps users track income and expenses through manual input, receipt scanning, and voice commands, offering a clear view of spending patterns. Its personalized budgeting feature aids in managing spending limits, while savings goal planning supports consistent savings. Anggar.In also provides financial analysis tools, presenting spending trends and insights to help users become more aware of their finances. The investment recommendation system can also guide users towards financial freedom.

Leveraging machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile technology, Anggar.In aims to boost financial awareness, foster sustainable habits, and support informed decision-making, helping Indonesians navigate economic challenges and build long-term financial resilience.

>>EDIT TEKS DIBAWAH INI DENGAN BACKGROUNDER MOBILE DEVELOPMENT DI PROJECT BRIEF

In the Machine Learning path, we developed several features, starting with our MVP [stock prediction](https://github.com/Anggar-In/Machine-Learning/tree/main/stock_price_predictions) and [recommendation models](https://github.com/Anggar-In/Machine-Learning/tree/main/stockRecommendation)  for a financial freedom calculator. These models utilize TensorFlow, are saved using TensorFlow.js for web deployment, preprocess data using Min-Max Scaler for normalization, and apply time series forecasting for stock price prediction alongside linear regression for stock recommendations. Beyond the MVP, we also building supplementary features beyond the MVP, such as [Receipt OCR](https://github.com/Anggar-In/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Receipt_OCR) and [Audio Recognition](https://github.com/Anggar-In/Machine-Learning/tree/main/AudioRecognition). The Receipt OCR leverages the Pytesseract library for extracting text from images, while the Audio Recognition feature utilizes the WebSpeech API. Both systems are tuned with preprocessing techniques for image or audio and use regex for data extraction. This feature is useful for automating expense and income tracking.
